          was ranked the number one hospital in Thailand (Worlds Best Hospitals
          2023 Thailand), with a score of 93.00%, among the 30 Thai hospitals
          listed on their best hospitals in Thailand list. Bumrungrad has been
          named the best hospital in Thailand for three years running.
          Furthermore, Bumrungrad ranked 182nd out of 250 hospitals worldwide,
          making it the only Thai hospital in the top 250. Four primary factors
          were used by the international panel of eminent experts to calculate
          the rankings: 1) Medical experts&apos; recommendations (doctor, hospital
          manager, and over 80,000 healthcare professionals from 2,300 hospitals
          in 28 countries); 2) Patient experience survey results; 3) Hospital
          quality metrics, including patient-to-doctor ratio, hygienic measures
          and safety, and quality of care for particular treatments; and 4)
          Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) implementation survey. PROMs
          were utilized in the procedure for the first time in this instance.
