              Rak Jai Thai (Healing Hearts),

        <p className="text-justify mt-6">
          Every year, some 8,000 Thai children are affected by congenital
          cardiac disease, with half of them needing surgery. Many of these kids
          could die or suffer from serious health problems if they don't get
          surgery. While many of these kids can get the necessary cardiac
          procedures thanks to the government's current health insurance policy,
          the majority of them come from low-income homes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mt-6">
          However, the annual number of pediatric patients eligible for surgery
          remains restricted, despite government aid. Consequently, a
          significant number of children consistently await surgery, with this
          figure increasing annually. In response, the Bumrungrad International
          Hospital Foundation and
          <Link

          are fulfilling their social responsibility by providing the necessary
          free cardiac procedures for these children.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mt-6">
          These frequently extremely complex heart surgeries are performed by
          Bumrungrad's medical staff, who are proud to contribute their
          experience and knowledge while using cutting-edge medical technology.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mt-6">
          Concerning impoverished children with congenital heart disease, the
          Rak Jai Thai program has performed over 820 heart surgeries since 2003
          (as of August 1, 2021). Each procedure costs 750,000 baht on average.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify mt-6">
          Concerning the price of these surgeries, the program covers all
          aspects of the patient's treatment, from diagnostics to surgery to
          additional hospital fees. The program also covers the cost of travel,
          meals, and lodging for parents or guardians. This ensures that
          families experiencing financial difficulties can bring their loved
          ones to Bumrungrad for treatment.
